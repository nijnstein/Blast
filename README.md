# BLAST
#### See https://github.com/nijnstein/BLAST-Documentation for documentation


BLAST has become freely available for anyone, its license headers yet state otherwise. We will update the licenses shortly to reflect Blast's current state: free to use. 

A lot of work remains on Blast and how fast it gets done depends on how many active users it has. Nevertheless a lot of needs can be fulfilled with this high performance oriented script engine for use in Unity.
