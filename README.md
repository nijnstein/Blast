# BLAST
#### See https://github.com/nijnstein/BLAST-Documentation for documentation


BLAST has become freely available for anyone, 

A lot of work remains on Blast and how fast it gets done depends on how many active users it has. Nevertheless a lot of needs can be fulfilled with this performance oriented script engine for use in Unity.

If you earn money with a product using blast you should buy a license in the unity asset store which grants you bugfix support for $4,99/seat.
